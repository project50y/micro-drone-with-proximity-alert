# finalyear_project
Ateam of four students at makerere university comes up with a project that showcases an advanced obstacle detection system that utilizes 
LiDAR technology and Arduino microcontrollers to enhance safety and navigation for autonomous vehicles and robotics applications. The system efficiently detects obstacles in the surroundings, enabling autonomous vehicles to make informed decisions and avoid collisions.
